# Profession Categorization Framework

This framework proposes a hierarchical categorization system for professions, designed to be comprehensive and align with established industry and occupational classification standards while also being intuitive for users of the A19 Trade School platform.

## Rationale

The framework is built upon a two-level hierarchy:

1.  **Level 1: Industry/Sector:** These are broad industry groupings that provide a high-level overview. They are inspired by existing industry classification systems like NAICS and GICS, and also incorporate the user's current platform categories (Technology, Business, Healthcare, Skilled Trades, Creative Arts, Agriculture).
2.  **Level 2: Specific Professions/Occupations:** These are the detailed job roles and professions within each top-level industry/sector. The classification at this level will be heavily informed by the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides a robust and widely recognized method for categorizing occupations.

This hybrid approach allows for both broad industry navigation and detailed occupational specificity, making the platform user-friendly and data-rich.
