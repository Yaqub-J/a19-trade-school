## 1. Career Overview

### What Does a Registered Nurse Do?

Registered Nurses (RNs) are healthcare professionals who provide and coordinate patient care, educate patients and the public about various health conditions, and offer advice and emotional support to patients and their family members [1, 6, 19]. Their duties typically include assessing patient health problems and needs, developing and implementing nursing care plans, and maintaining medical records [5, 9, 16]. RNs administer nursing care to ill, injured, convalescent, or disabled patients [16]. They perform physical exams, take health histories, administer medications and treatments, and operate medical equipment [14, 17]. RNs work collaboratively with doctors and other healthcare professionals to ensure patient-centered care [6, 18].

### Industry Context

Registered Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, working in a wide variety of settings including hospitals (the largest employer), physicians' offices, home healthcare services, nursing care facilities, and schools [1, 19]. They play a critical role in direct patient care, case management, establishing nursing practice standards, developing quality assurance procedures, and directing other healthcare personnel [3]. The nursing profession is essential for public health, disease prevention, and health promotion across all demographics.

### Work Environment

RNs work in diverse environments, which can range from fast-paced and high-stress settings like emergency rooms and intensive care units to more routine environments in clinics or schools [1, 19]. The work often involves shifts, including nights, weekends, and holidays, especially in hospital settings. It can be physically demanding, requiring long periods of standing, walking, lifting, and assisting patients. RNs must also be prepared to handle emotionally challenging situations and maintain composure under pressure. While direct patient care is common, some RNs work in administrative, research, or educational roles with more traditional office hours.

### Career Appeal

The Registered Nurse career is highly appealing due to its strong and consistent demand, competitive salaries, and the profound impact RNs have on patients' lives [12]. It offers a wide range of specialization options, allowing nurses to pursue areas of interest such as pediatrics, critical care, oncology, or mental health [4, 17]. The profession provides opportunities for continuous learning and career advancement into leadership, education, or advanced practice roles [4, 15]. The ability to make a tangible difference in people's health and well-being is a significant source of job satisfaction for many RNs.
