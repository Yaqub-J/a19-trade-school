## Phase 6: Generate roadmaps for remaining professions systematically

- [x] Read the `profession_list.csv` file to get the full list of professions.
- [x] Identify professions for which roadmaps have not yet been generated.
- [ ] For each remaining profession:
    - [ ] Conduct deep research to gather information for each section of the roadmap (Career Overview, Entry Requirements, Career Progression Levels, Skills Development Matrix, Education and Certification Pathways, Salary and Compensation Analysis, Industry Outlook and Trends, Resources and Next Steps).
    - [ ] Populate the `roadmap_template.md` with the gathered information to create the specific roadmap for the profession.
    - [ ] Save the generated roadmap as a new Markdown file (e.g., `[profession_name]_roadmap.md`).
- [ ] Mark this phase as complete in `todo.md`.
